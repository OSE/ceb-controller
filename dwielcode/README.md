This is the code for dwiel's version of the CEB press control code.  It is not
yet merged into the official version, but will be once it is a bit more stable.

It provides a pause button as well as a pressure relief sensor which will stop
all hydraulics if an over pressure sitation is detected.

More testing will be done this spring/summer with my CEB Press to iron
everything out.

TODO:

* update board layout with new board
* add header for FeF CEB Press pinout
* more testing of code
