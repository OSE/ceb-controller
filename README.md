# CEB Press - Arduino Software

Arduino software to power an open source, high-performance Compresssed Earth Block press.

Compresssed Earth Block building is the highest quality natural building method.
See the [CEB Intro Page](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/CEB_Press) for more introductory
information about compressed earth blocks.

## How to compile (on Ubuntu Linux)

### Install arduino

    sudo apt-get install -y arduino

### Get the code

If you're using a release, download it from https://github.com/OSE/ceb-controller/releases and extract it.

If you want to work with the latest development code, check out the code:

    git clone https://github.com/OSE/ceb-controller.git

The code is in CEBManual (even though it is automatic, it also allows
for manual control)

the board directory has the necessary details to build a controller
board that this code runs on.
